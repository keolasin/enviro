# Lecture 1: Systems Thinking

## Objectives

- Understand the basic principles of systems thinking
- learn how systems thinking is applied in environmental healht sciences
- understand basics of how you can build conceptual models and test them
  
## Complexity in systems

- large number of heterogeneous elements
  - simple to complex
  - acting at various levels
- elements interact with each other through positive and negative feedback loops
- interactions result in unpredictable phenomena
- ecological and social interactions

## Features of systems thinking

- related parts that receive inputs and generate outputs
- change temporally and spatially
- nested within larger systems
- marked by flows (energy, info, pollutants, etc)
- feedback loops (negative and positive)
- adaptive

**Example:** hierarchy of mining in brazil
Economic incentives for mining, causing individuals to work in a mine, exposed to occupational hazards
Systems can become a complex mess!

## Taxonomy for systems thinking

1. Mind maps - gather thoughts
   1. exploratory and few rules
2. concept maps - organize your understanding
   1. still exploratory, but now you begin to name the relationships between the items
3. Systems model - map the system
   1. document a system as accurately as possible; usually based on data
   2. help you become an expert in understanding the system
   3. can be confusing and complex
4. Mental Models - help to improve understanding and communicate
5. Conceptual models - provide a way to think about a complex system
   1. convey the fundamental principles and basic functionality of the system
   2. contains core ideas

### Why use Conceptual Models?

- can help to test and clarify your thinking
- can help you understand who you need to engage in order to make progress toward a goal
  - discover new allies
- can help you convey ideas and get people on the same page
- understand what data you need for analyses

### Making a conceptual model

First, ask if you understand the goals

- determine relationships, inspect concepts, concept inventory

Then, dialog, visualize, and evaluate. Ask if someone else understands what you've produced

### Understanding the context (example)

SF homelessness and people unable to afford housing in the region.

- Jay Graham concerned with lack of hygiene for unhomed persons.
- How does placement of a public bathroom affect fecal contamination on sidewalk?

### Steps for developing a conceptual model

1. Create a center statement or outcome of interest
   1. work outwards from this center statement
2. Develop variables or elements radially outward
3. Use lines to show connections
4. Use research findings to undergird connections
5. Socialize the model with stakeholders
6. Refine

Can be an acyclic model (like a directed acyclic graph, DAG) or cyclic

#### Systems model Example: UK land use and factors that influence it

#### Example: antimicrobial resistance

Stage 1: high number of baceteria including good bacteria, baceteria causing illness, and few resistant bacteria
Stage 2: abx kills off all bacteria except for abx resistance bacteria
Stage 3: Drug resistant bacteria now has conditions to grow and take over
Stage 4: drug resistant bacteria can transfer its mutation to other bacteria

So, we can make a conceptual model for antibiotic resistant bacteria spreading in the community **(14:30)**

#### Example: Systems model of AMR in the environment (15:40)

## Understanding parts of the system

If I do a study, typically need to break up the system into manageable components.

## Creating causal models to test mathematically

- models can provide a platform for in silico experiments to inform our understanding
- generate refined hypotheses
- interpret empirical observations
  - within-host models
  - population-level models
  - vary in complexity and inherent assumptions

## Conclusions

- Systems thinking allows us to develop better understanding of causes of environmental health problems
- Help you to explore and refine the effects of different interventions
- Enhance the use of existing data and understand what other data are needed.
