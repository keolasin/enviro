# Lecture 8.1.2: Climate Change and Health

Examples of climate induced healthj outcomes

Various pathways through which climate change affects human health:

1. direct exposures
2. indirect exposures
3. Social and economic disruption

## Direct effects health pathways

Insult: exposure to thermal extremes, impact of increase rate of heat and cold related illness and death

Insult: increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events; impact of increased deaths, injuries, illnesses, psych disorders, damage to health infrastructure

## Indirect effects

Insult: Sea level rise; Impact of increased deaths and injuries due to flooding, health problems related to reduced availability of fresh water

Insult: Increased air pollution; Impact of acute and chronic lung disease, allergic disorders, cardiovascular disease

Insult: social, econ, and demographic dislocations from changes in economy/infrastructure; impact of wide range of public health consequences

### Exposure to Thermal Extremes: Heat Related Illnesses

High temp + high humidity + physical work = heat illness

Heat waves are defined as periods of three consecutive days during which max temp is above the threshold (90 degrees).

Heat stroke and heat exhaustion can occur, typically in older populations or those who do physical work.

#### Heat wave in France 2003

Excess mortality increased during the heatwave in France in 2003.

- resulted in more than 14,800 deaths in France
- 60% of those deaths occurred in persons above 75
- 35,000 deaths across Europe during this heatwave

### Extreme weather events: Malaria

- malaria found in more than 100 countries
- 300 - 500 million cases of malaria worldwide
- 214 million cases of malaria in 2015 and 438,000 deaths
- vulnerable populations: infants, young children, pregnant women
- disease can cause fever, headache, sweats, nausea, shaking, chills
  - severe form: cerebral malaria, anemia, kidney failure

#### Mosquito lifecycle

- hatching takes 2-3 days (2-3 weeks in colder climates)
- egg-to-adult cycle takes 10-14 days
- adult Anopheles live ~1-2 weeks
- A. gambiae prefers to lay eggs in sunny, open spaces

#### Climate change factors & influence in malaria rates

1. increase in temperature
   1. shortens development time of mosquito
   2. hsortens development time of parasite in mosquito
   3. affects seasonality of malaria transmission
2. Increase in rainfall
   1. increases mosquito density by increasing available breeding habitat
   2. decreases mosquito density by flushing larvae
   3. increases humidity; >50% optimal for mosquito lifespan

#### Malaria parasite development and temperature

with rising temperature, it can shorten the period of extrinsic incubation and increases the survival of parasites, making them active and infective earlier

#### Effect of rainfall on larvae flushing and mortality

rainfall provides more space for mosquito breeding, but can also decrease the larvae.

## El Nino and Health

- produces drought in Australia, India, Indonesia, Phillippines, Brazil, venezuela, parts of africa, central America, Western Canada, and North Central US
- produces wetter conditions in southern brazil, argentina, east central africa, southernmost india, and sri lanka, southern US, and parts of Peru and Ecuador
- Produces heavy rains in desert-like regions
- heavy events can cause floods, mudslides, and tornadoes
- Enhances tropical storms in the eastern pacific, threatening the west coast of Mexico and the US
- typhoons and hurricanes affect islands that are normally unaffected

Causes upsurges in:

1. waterborne diseases
2. vector-borne pathogens

Can lead to outbreaks of infectious diseases

### Peru and El Nino

During el nino, non-cholera diarrhea admissions increased by 200%, even in the winter months

## Climate Change and Health: an Equity Issue

developed countries contribute more to climate change, while developing countries are only starting to contribute or barely contribute at all

But, these developed countries bear less of the burden of disease resulting from climate change, while developing countries bear the brunt of disease

### Distribution of Health Impact from Climate Change

- the impact of cc is not just based on current year's emissions, but cumulative emissions in the atm.
- Natural debt: we can use natural debt as an indicator for the environmental risk transition and imposed health from GHG, by income, in the year 2000
- poorer countries impose much less risk than rich coutnries, but experience more health burdens attributable to climate change
