# Lecture 8.1.1: Climate Change: Background

- highlighted in 1950, but only in 1992 was it given much thought by UN: creation of UN framework convention on climate change
  - called for stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
  - no timelines
  - no consensus
  
## The Kyoto Protocol developed by COP, formalized UNFCC of 1992

US Senate at the time criticized Kyoto Protocol for not requiring action by developing countries, and others criticized it for being too little to make a significant difference

- Enacted in 2005

## COP18

UNFCC member countries in 2012 agreed to extend the life of the Kyoto Protocol until 2020, but to come up with a new plan in 2015.

COP21 in Paris agreed to make a non-binding pledge to reduce GHG emissions and limit warming to well below 2 degrees.

## 2015 paris COP21

200 countries that are party to the 2015 paris climate deal were unable to agree on rules on a carbon market and trading emissions credits between countries, covered by Article 6 of the Paris Agreement

### Article 6 of Paris Agreement

aims at promoting a cooperation mechanism that will assist govs in implementing their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) or GHGs reductions through voluntary international cooperation. It seeks to establish a policy foundation for an emissions trading system.

- goal is to get a global price on carbon.

## Earth's Weather, Climate, and the Greenhouse Effect

### Weather

day to day variations in temp, precip, wind, cloud cover, and atm pressure.

### Climate

consists of averages of weather extremes that is hot and cold, wet/dry, snowpack/snowmelt, winds and storms.

Climate is driven by the energy input from the Sun, sunlight warms the earth's surface and atm. It then drives the convetion currents in the oceans and atm and the throughout the globe.

### Greenhouse Effect

The atmosphere absorbs some of Sun's radiation before it reaches Earth surface. The earth surface radiates heat back upward, but, GHG trap 90% of this heat and re-radiate it back to the surface, which can help keep it warm and support life.

But: although GHG effect is natural, emission of more GHGs in the atm can alter the climate system and create dangerous climate changes.

#### Radiative balance, Greenhouse effect, and Radiative Forcing

pg 7 of reader has good image for heat reaching the earth's surface and radiating back into atmosphere and being absorbed at various levels (GHGs)

### Albedo, GHGs, and Warming Potentials

Albedo is the light reflection coefficient, varies depending on the surface measured.

- albedo greater for snow, water, clouds.
- albedo much lower for asphalt, fields

#### Radiative Forcing

imbalance between incoming solar radiation, and outgoing infrared radiation.

Net total warming is much greater due to human activities, but there are some cooling effects occurring as well

- certain aerosols can cause cooling effect
- CO2, methane, NO can cause warming effects and greatly outweight the cooling effects from human activity

### Impact of atmospheric and seawater CO2 on Seawater acidity

Oceans and plant life play major roles in uptake of CO2.

- 55% of anthropogenic CO2 absorbed by oceans/plants
  - 30% into ocean, 25% into plants
- ocean acidification has occurred as a result: increased by 30% since pre-industrial era

ocean acidification inhibits skeleton and shell growth in marine species, particularly clams, oysters, and corals.

- this can result in food insecurity by disruption of marine ecologies

### Precipitation

per 1 degree increase in warming results in 7% increase of atm capacity to hold water vapor.

- this results in greater precipitation, but might vary depending on the region.
- wet areas get wetter, dry areas get dryer

### Sea Level Rise

Two factors affecting sea level rise:

1. melting ice seheets in Antarctica and glaciers
2. Thermal expansion due to absorption of heat by the ocean

Sea level rise isn't equally distributed around the world.

### Extreme Heat Waves

change in temperature has caused increased length, intensity, and frequency of heat extremes in many regions.

- could be a dramatic rise in high-temperature extremes in many parts of the world
  - heat wave in 2003 in Europe,
  - greece heatwave in 2007
  - Russia in 2010
  - Texas in 2011
