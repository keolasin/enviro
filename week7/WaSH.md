Discussion

## US WaSH

Deaths in the US during the 20th century due to infectious diseases have declined markedly

Public health successes:

1. Water chlorination/filtration
2. Creation of public health departments
3. Introduction of vaccines

### Typhoid mortality in the US and european cities

- in 2017, 12-16 million new cases of typhoid fever
  - 77,000-219,000 deaths
- transmission through contaminated water was recognized a decade earlier by William Budd in the 1850's
- Annual typhoid deaths dropped after water filtration
  - accompanied by drop in other infections

Across low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC), one in ten deaths in children younger than 5 years is due to diarrhea

- 3rd leading cause of death in children
- ~300,000 deaths among children in 2017
- decreased ~70% between 1990 and 2017

Sahel region in Africa (where climate change is likely to have large impacts) is already deeply impacted by diarrhea mortality

### Variability across a country

Diarrhea mortality in Indonesia in 2000 and 2017

- substantial variation in both space and time

### Diarrhea and nutrition

Over time, a child has a typical expected weight due to growth.

But, with diarrhea, it can cause lower weights and malnutrition

#### Environmental enteric dysfunction and child growth

- common to kids living in unhygienic environments
- damages the intestinal tract

#### Frequency of enteric pathogen detection in young children (Dhaka vs Virginia)

Kids without diarrhea had much lower number of enteric pathogens in their stools

Why asymptomatic carriage of pathogens?

- dose of pathogen
- pathogenicity of strain
- maternal immunity
- breastfeeding
- immunity gained from previous clinical or subclinical infections
- protective intestinal microbiome

## Millenium Development Goals (2000-2015)

1. Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
2. achieve universal primary school
3. promote gender equality and empower women
4. reduce child mortality
5. improve maternal health
6. combat HIV/aids, malaria, and other diseases
7. ensure environmental sustainability
8. develop a partnership for development

### Sustainable Development Goals (2015-2030)

1. No poverty
2. zero hunger
3. good health and well-being
4. quality education
5. gender equality
6. clean water and sanitation
7. affordable and clean energy
8. decent work and economic growth
9. industry, innovation, and infrastructure
10. reduced inequalities
11. sustainable cities and communities
12. responsible consumption and production
13. climate action
14. life below water
15. life on land
16. peace, justice and strong institutions
17. partnerships for the goals

## Water, sanitation, and hygiene interventions

F diagram:

break disease transmission by reducing exposures

1. fluids
2. fields, floors
3. flies
   1. food
4. fingers
5. fomites

### Limited funding, so what's most effective?

Baseline water supplies and interventions, so we compare them to unimproved water supplies

1. Piped, high quality water reduces RR to 0.21 from 0.89 (unimproved source)
2. Sewer connections also reduce to 0.31
3. handwashing with soap brings down to 0.60

Economic costs of poor water and sani in selected countries, as a precentage of GDP

- there's an argument that countries need to invest in WaSH to improve their economies

## Water contaminants

Mainly concerned with E. Coli, arsenic, and fluoride in a global context

### Haiti cholera outbreak

- in 2010, ~10,000 deaths due to Vibrio cholerae
- 7% case-fatality rate initially - among highest recorded rates in recent history
- untreated wastewater from UN peacekeeper camp dumped into Artibonite river (a source of drinking water)

### contamination during transport

Water can become contaminated during transport, handling, and storage

- people commonly have to collect and store their own water, where it can become contaminated

Rainwater catchments

Protected springs in Zambia

- storage of spring water that is then gravity fed to the community

Motorized water filter systems - Haiti

- gas powered water filter system to supply water to those displaced from Haiti earthquake in 2010

### Household water treatment and safe storage

- chlorination, safe water system
- combined flocculent-disinfectant
- ceramic filtration
- biosand filtration
- solar disinfection/SODIS
- Boiling

### WaSH NGO making chlorine for drinking water treatment - Haiti

chlorine doesn't kill cryptosporidium

### safely managed drinking water in 2017

- 5.3 billion people used safely managed services
- 1.4 billion used at least basic services
- 435 million used unimproved sources
- 144 million used surface water

### Systematic review of water quality studies comparing improved versus unimproved water sources

- lower contamination found for improved sources relative to unimproved sources
- higher risk of contamination in rural areas compared to urban areas
- need to adjust safe drinking water coverage estimates based on actual water quality measurements

## What is Sanitation?

The safe removal of human excreta from the household environment

Toilet -> containment/storage/treatment -> conveyance -> treatment -> end use/disposal

Shared sanitation between households is considered unimproved

How cleanable is the facility?

**It's not just about building infrastructure**

### Good sanitation

- reduces spread of intestinal worms, schistosomiasis and trachoma
- reduces the severity and impact of malnutrition
- promotes dignity and boosts safety
- promotes school attendance
- facilitates recovery of water, renewable energy and nutrients from fecal waste

### Population with limited and unimproved sanitation services and open defecation in 2000 and 2017

### What is appropriate?

- appropriate sanitation solutions:
  - affordable
  - available
  - culturally acceptable
  - easy to use and maintain
    - sufficient capacity for O&M
  - environmentally sound
