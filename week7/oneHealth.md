# Lecture 7.2.1: One Health and Emerging Infectious Diseases

## Evolving concepts: One Health, EcoHealth, Planetary Health, Global health

**One Health**: current focus is still on public health and veterinary health

**EcoHealth**: focus is on the relationship between health and ecosystems

- humans and animals are more on par in One Health and EcoHealth

**Planetary Health**: focus seems to be more antropocentric, narrowest focus on interdisciplinary research, and emphasis is on human health and related research areas. Does include sustainability and natural resources as core concepts

**Global Health**: broad collaborative and transnational approach to improve health for all

- in contrast, planetary health emphasizes the need ofr sustainability based on natural resources

## Emerging infectious diseases

An emerging infectious disease is typically an outbreak of new or known disease that are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographic range in the last 2 decades.

- estimated 175 emerging diseases
- 75% oif those classified as zoonotic

Major economic and social costs

- H5N1 outbreak
  - losses of ~$20Bn

List of known pathogens represent only a small fraction of the total number of potential pathogens in nature.

## Trends that can affect emerging infectious diseases

- World population growth (>9 billion by 2050)
- accelerated economic development for many parts of the world
- rapid urbanization
  - 6.3 billion of the 9.3 billion humans will live in urban areas by 2050
- loss of global forest cover
  - 2.3 million sq km lost annually against a gain of 0.8
- climate change

### West Nile Virus

- detected for first time in Western Hemisphere in 1999
- influenza-like symptoms and can be fatal
- mosquito vector and birds are the primary vertebrate reservoir of the virus
- entered Canada by 2001 and human cases in 2002
- changes in vector populations, bird populations, and temperature

### Human Ebola Outbreak

2013 ebola outbreak, affecting Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.

- 60x larger than any previous Ebola outbreak
- more than 11000 lives lost
- causes hemorrhagic fever and is an emerging zoonotic viral disease typically in central africa

#### Animal:Human and Human:Human Interactions

pathogen spillover to humans is typically through the use or consumption of bush meat.

#### Seasonal factors and wildlife behavior

meteorological and hydrologic conditions may be associated with Ebola, like drier conditions at the end of a rainy season increasing outbreaks.

## The environment and infectious diseases

William Wells (1930s) - engineer who studied environmental determinants of infectious diseases

- "Failure to discover air-borne infection ... [doesn't] prove it's absence"
- "... transmission of infection through air may take one of two forms depending upon the size of the infected droplet."

**Airborne precautions**: the droplet can float in the air for a long time

**Droplet route**: the droplets quickly fall out of the air

## Case Study: Antibiotic use in small-scale livestock producers in Ecuador

### Global Livestock and poultry production

- smallholder farming in low and LMIC countries
  - approximately 500M farms with livestock and poultry
  - small and medium farms (<50 ha) produce 51-77% of nearly all commodities and nutrients
- Growth in demand for animal-source nutrition
- Promotion of small-scale food animal production in LMICs
  - livelihoods
  - nutrition

#### Use of abx in animal agriculture

Exposure routes and pathways to contaminants from concentrated animal feeding operations

- practice of using abx in animal agriculture is huge, 4x use of abx for animals than people in the US

#### Increase in AMR

in a study of E. Coli, more than 70% of e. coli isolates were susceptible to abx in the 1950s.

But, by 2000, seeing increase of multi drug resistant bacteria

#### AMR: Environment to humans

Agricultural antibiotic use ->

- release of active antimicrobials into environ
- resistance in non-pathogens
- resistance in pathogens

all resulting in increased resistant infections in humans

### Pilot study of abx resistance in children and animals in Ecuador

- surveys in households with children and small-scale livestock and poultry
- collected fecal samples from children, livestock, and poultry
- tested antibiotic susceptibility of E. coli isolates
  - children (n = 64)
  - livestock and poultry (n = 174)
- 35% of E. coli from children and livestock and poultry were resistant to 3 or more classes of abx
  - shared the same plasmid types and resistance genes

#### Abx use common among small-scale livestock and poultry producers

- conducted in-depth interviews with small-scale food-animal producers
- nearly hafl of producers interviewed considered abx important for growth promotion
- multiple respondents claimed that their animals rarely get sick and credited antibiotics with animal health
- producers had a limited understanding of abx resistance

"The feed has antibiotics, vitamins. Because of that the animals grow faster. We use medicines more because we raise them inside, because otherwise they die. The animals that are in the fields don't get sick."

#### One health and abx resistance

- small-scale production occurs in the household environment
  - spillover of abx resistance likely
- small-scale livestock and poultry producers' decisions driven by household economics, not societal consequences
- antibiotics readily available for small-scale livestock and poultry
- lack of veterinary capacity
  - abx prescribing carried out by untrained individuals (not vets)

## Closing remarks

- disease eradication has potential
  - smallpox eradicated in 1980
  - major gains with a number of diseases
- certain pathogenic organisms spread rapidly
- economic and social changes have occurred rapidly
- inter-disciplinary scientific approaches needed
- organizational culture and behavior varies
