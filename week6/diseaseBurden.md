# Lecture 6.1.1: Environmental Burden of Disease

WHO's def of environmental health:

- Environmental health comprises of those aspects of human health, including quality of life, that are determined by physical, chemical, biological, social, and psychosocial factors in the environment..."
- "... It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing, correcting, controlling, preventing those factors in the environment that can potentially affect adversely the health of present and future generations."

## How much ill health is attributable to environmental factors?

### Ill Health?

- used global burden of disease (GBD) database (1990)
- the disability adjusted life year (DALY) used as the basic unit of ill health
- included 22 categories of global burden of death and diseases causing at least 1% of DALYs

### Attributable risk?

The amount of ill-health that would not exist today if the exposure to the risk factor had not occurred in the past

- assumes all other risk factor remain constant
- counter-factual level important, (e.g. what lower exposure level would have been possible?)

#### Environmental factor?

defined as everything non-genetic, non-behavioral, non-social, and measurable physical, chemical, or biological agents passing through environmental pathways that reach human.

**Exclusion**

- genetic risk factors
- diet, but food additives included (NaCl)
- active smoking, but passive smoking included
- sexual behavior, alcohol, drug abuse, and criminal violence

**Inclusion**

- all workplace injuries/disease, including military
- household, community, and larger-scaled behavioral factors related to hygiene
- road accidents, falls, drowning
- housing complex = combination of crowding, ventilation, chilling, drainage
- natural disasters

## Environmental contribution to the GBD

- 22 conditions account for 72% of the GBD
- 25-33% GBD attributed to environmental risk factors
- children <5 years 12%, but 43% GBD due to environmental risk factors

## Preventing disease through healthy environments - 2006

- 24% of the GBD and 23% of deaths linked to environmental risk factors
- in children, 36% of disease burden attributed to the environment, mostly in developing countries
- unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation and hygiene ~ insufficient access accounted for 94%
- lower respiratory infection due to use of solid fuel ~ 42% in developing, 20% in developed countries
- other unintentional injuries ~ 44% due to malaria

### A comparative risk assessment of GBD - 2010

67 risk factors and risk factor clusters in 21 regions, 1990-2010: a systematic analysis for the GBD study 2010

4.3 million deaths attributed to household air pollution, majority in low and low-middle income countries.

Household air pollution - associated with ALRI, lung cancer, COPD, stroke, IHD

### Population (%) using solid fuel vs GDP

We can see that richer countries tend to use less solid fuels (inverse relationship between solid fuel use and wealth)
