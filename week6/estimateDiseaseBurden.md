# Lecture 6.1.3: Burden of Disease Estimates

Global burden of disease projects and global burden disease trends between 1990 til 2013

## GBD Project

**For this section, best to review the reader, as it is largely tables/graphs**

### The Goal: C4 Database

Combined: include morbidity and mortality
Comprehensive: includes all regions and major sources of death and disability
Consistent: Disease and disability are defined consistently across all regions and sub-groups
Coherent: The sum of each part is equal to the total

### GBD 1990

Group 1: Communicable, maternal, perinatal, and nutritional
Group 2: noncommunicable
Group 3: accidents and injuries

Review tables of global burden of diseases, 1990: pages 26-27 reader

### GBD 2001

- Leading cause of death in least developed countries was communicable disease
- Developed countries have life-style related chronic diseases: diabetes, obseity, HTN, CVD

#### Causes of death in young children

sub-saharan africa had high contribution, partly due to malaria, infectious diseases, diarrhoeal diseases

#### DALYs in 2001

Again, sub-saharan africa was afflicted by HIV/AIDs and other infectious/parasitic diseases

## Limitations

Reassessment of the cost of chronic helmintic infection: a meta-analysis of disability-related outcomes in endemic schistosomiasis

Basically, the assignment of disability weights can be misleading/inaccurate

### Age weighting/discounting

Age weighting and discounting of future weighting:

- 3% discounting of future health effects
  - This means that the healthy life-year now is worth more than a healthy life-year later, which isn't necessarily true
  - results in dampening the impact of deaths of very young or total DALYs
- Age weighting

Discounting is rarely used in epidemiology

Age weighting is unacceptable on an equity basis, since every year should be considered to have equal value. Age weighting results in lost years of life having greater value when they occur at young adult ages.

## Future of Global Burden of Disease Estimates

- identify vulnerable population
- guide priority for health intervention
- track health improved
- helpful to assess the cost-effectiveness
- aDALY, an Avoided Disability-Adjusted Life Year, seeks to present interventions that void most DALYs, or a reduction in the burden of disease.
