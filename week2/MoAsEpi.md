# Lecture 2.2.4: Measures of association

Things to consider

## Random error

the effects of random variation or chance in the data

## Systematic error or bias

The possibility of bias in the study design

Sources of bias:

1. selection bias
   1. LTFU, selection of hospital cases/control, basically who winds up in or is excluded from the study can cause bias
2. information bias
   1. misclassification bias (someone is classified as having exposure or disease when they don't actually)
3. confounding
   1. a third factor distorts the relationship between the exposure and outcome

## Assessment of random error

### p-values

statistical measures of difference between two groups

### Confidence intervals

Indicate the range of possible values in which the true value of the odds ratio is likely to lie, if there is no bias affecting the results

## Association vs Causation

Bradfor Hill's Criteria for causation:

1. strength of association
2. consistence - is the effect observed in other studies as well?
3. specificity - is the exposure to the agent associated with particular types of disease?
4. Temporality - does exposure preceed the effect?
5. dose - response relationship (does increasing dose result in greater disease)
6. Biological plausibility - is there a plausibile biological mechanism
7. coherence - is the association consistent with the biology of disease?
8. Experiment - does reducing exposure reduce/prevent the disease?
9. analogy - do other elements of similar nature (tobacco vs wood smoke) produce the effect?
