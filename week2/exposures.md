# Exposures

## Types of exposures

ACEs, musculoskeletal damage from load carrying, housing (mold), physical risks from extreme weather events

## Exposure assessment design consideration

1. Purpose of assessment
2. study parameters
   1. Who?
   2. What are the hazards/exposures?
   3. measurement parameters?
   4. time frame?
   5. statistical measures?
3. Study Design
   1. objectives to measurement parameters
   2. Sample and sample size
   3. Data collection method
   4. statistical analysis plan
   5. QA/QC plan
   6. cost

## Environmental exposures

Which exposures do we measure?

Known causal hazardous exposures

- 100 confirmed in the last century or so
- account for about half of world-wide mortality

Exposure assessment has focused largely on exposures that are known or suspected of causing disease

- EPA: 126 priority pollutants and an overlapping list of 187 hazardous air pollutants
- NHANES: 300 environmental chemicals and nutrients (eg. smoking, alcohol, pesticides, PCBs, heavy metals, vitamins)
- OSHA: ~400 permissible exposure limits (eg. benzene, asbestos)

### Hierarchy of exposure assessment

Might have trade-off of increasing accuracy, but decreasing convenience

## Reconstruct exposures

### Job exposure reconstruction

- relies on historical records
- job-exposure matrix (JEM)
- Expert Judgment (used for industrial hygiene)
  - quality exposure depends on the 'expert'
  - judgment improves with use of measurements to train the 'expert'

### Using citizens to collect exposure data (citizen-science)

Can have variable quality, but increase the resources available to measure exposures

### Time Weighted Averages for exposure

Within and between person exposure variability - may need repeated exposure measurements to create better exposure estimates

Gives a more representative measure of exposure

1. Determine average concentration of PM10 during mining activities
2. Estimate hours exposed = 8h /day
3. Assuming no exposure while not working, time-weighted average exposure concentration = 

## Micro-environmental monitoring

Person's activity can significantly affect their exposures

- profile of a child's personal exposure to PM1.5 across a morning commute from home to school
- Exposure and time-location data are collected in real-time and apportioned into distinct microenvironments
  - home, in-transit, and at school

### Exposure relationships in micro-environment

exposure = 1/T * sum of the (concentration * micro environments * time spent in each environment)

weighted average for micro-environment = (t/T) * (Ci)

## Managing variability in exposure data

Many random variables affect exposure levels

- location
- source of contamination
- controls
- environmental factors

Exposure measurements are often variable and skewed

- take logarithms of exposure measurements to create a more normal distribution
  - distributions are 'approximately lognormal'
  - first observed for exposure measurements by Oldham (1953) for coal dust in mines
  - lognormal models of exposure for estimation + inference
