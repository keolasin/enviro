# Lecture 2.2.1: Epidemiology & Environmental Epidemiology

**Epidemiology**: epi involves the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations and the application of this study to control of health problems

**Environmental Epidemiology**: The epidemiologic investigation of the relationship between environmental exposures and states of health

## Cholera investigation in London

John Snow's investigation of cholera in london - maybe first study in environmental epidemiology

### Greater London Smog, 1952

Air pollution and exposure focus from epidemiologic studies

Exposures may have short latency periods or long latency periods

## Dose-response relationships

Lead concentration in blood differences between adults and children. 

### Examples

- Does exposure to low frequency EMR cause cancer?
- Arsenic in drinking water and cancer
- environmental factors and asthma
- does exposure to lead cause parkinson's disease?
- whether low mercury exposures cause autism?
- disease risks from environmental tobacco smoke
- relationship between air pollution and mortality
- relationship between radon and lung cancer
- whether household air pollution from cooking fires contributes to active or passive TB or cataract?

## How do we measure disease in epidemiology?

Count = number of people with disease
prevalence = number of people with disease / total number of people

might be point prevalence, period prevalence, cumulative (lifetime) prevalence

Incidence = number of new cases of disease / pop at risk in a time period

incidence is a rate: rate, rate ratio, describes the rate at which new disease cases are occurring in a population
