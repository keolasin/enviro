# Lecture 3.2.1: Toxicology Nuts and Bolts

## Dose Response Curves

Dose at which the first reponse effect is seen is called the threshold dose

## Sources of dose-response data

From Epidemiological Studies typically

Usually needs at least 4 criteria met:

1. temporal relationship
2. biological plausibility
3. dose-response relationship
4. statistical significance

Typically Cohort or case-control studies used to determine relationship

Sometimes however, animal studies are performed:

- Acute Lethality test
  - LD50 or median lethal dose
  - threshold level effect
  - maximum tolerated dose
- Chronic lethality test
  - no observed adverse effects levels (NOAEL)
  - lowest observed adverse effects level (LOAEL)

## Dose-response curve in regulation

Dose-response curve used by FDA to protect public health

In 1937, the use of diethylene glycol was used to treat streptococcal infection, but it ended up killing more than 100 people.

FDCA (food, drug, cosmetic act) requires manufacturers to show the FDA that their drugs are safe before sent to market. FDA scientists published methods and tests needed to demonstrate safety of a chemical

### Acceptable Daily Dose, or ADI

The maximum amount of chemical in milligram per kg day weight, per day, to which a person can be exposed to on a daily basis for the duration of a lifetime

In a regulatory view, non-carcinogenic chemicals are believed to operate on a threshold mechanism. Carcinogens are thought to work throug a non-threshold mechanism. Acceptable minimum risk is 1 in 1 million for carcinogens.

## Mechanisms of Toxicity

**Toxicants**: man-made harmful substances or by-products of anthropogenic substances such as pollutants produced by automobiles

**Toxin**: substances produced by living organisms (snakes, botulinum)

**Poison**: chemical or physical substances which are capable of causing adverse responses in biological organisms

**Toxicokinetics**: absorption, distribution, storage, biotransformation, and elimination

**Toxicodynamics**: mechanism by which toxicants produce cellular effects

### Toxicant entry into the body: Absorption

Toxicant entry into the body:

1. respiratory
   1. alveoli in lungs are where many toxicants enter the body due to large surface area
2. gastrointestinal
3. integumentary system

Factors that determine the rate of absorption:

1. Toxicant physical and chemical properties
2. route of administration
3. intake factor
4. age and sex
5. nutritional status
6. preexisting health condition

### Biotransformation

Typically phase 1 and phase 2 reactions, leading to rapid excretion and elimination of the toxicant. 

Phase 1 reaction typically occurs in the liver

### Bioactivation

biotransformation can also produce metabolites that are more or lexx toxic than the original compound (bioactivation)

vinyl chloride -> reactive epoxide intermediate (carcinogen)

### Factors affecting metabolism

- genetic
- differences in species
- sex
- genetic factors
- environment
- disease or pathological state
- age

### Elimination or excretion

after metabolism, the biotransformed compounds are eliminated or excreted from the body.

- the more rapidly the toxicants are removed from the body, the less likely they produce injury to the cells and tissues

Elimination refers to the removal of absorbed toxicant through excretion and also metabolism. The primary excretion route is typically kidneys -> urine. sometimes bile -> feces.

Can also be removed through the lungs

Sometimes removed through saliva, breast milk, sweat, tears, semen, hair, nails, and placenta.

### Toxicity and biologically effective dose

Some of amount of absorbed compound or dose may remain in the body and reaches targets, or sites of action, and cause a biological effect. **This is called the biologically effective dose**. 

- first affects molecules,
- then changes the biochemistry of the cells,
- which leads to disease or dysfunction of organs.
