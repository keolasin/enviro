# Lecture 3.1.2: Common Toxicity & Classification

## What makes Chemicals Toxic?

Determinants of toxicity:

1. Chemical composition
   1. determines the toxicity of a substance - similar chemical structures might have similar effects
2. Routes of exposure
   1. whether the chemical could cause toxicity or not
3. Duration of exposures
   1. the longer the exposure, the more likely that chemical remains in the body and affects health
4. Dose
   1. in general, the higher the dose, the greater the effect (dose-response relationship)
5. Body's ability to detoxify chemicals
   1. how well the body can detoxify chemicals
6. Individual susceptibility
   1. age, sex, preexisting disease, nutrition can affect toxicity

## Health effects caused by toxic substances

Organ Specific Toxicity

- liver toxicity
  - organic cheimicals, some metals: copper, cadmium
- kidney toxicity
  - heavy metals; insecticides; organic solvents; some prescription, non-prescription and illicit drugs
- Skin toxicity
  - phenol, parathion, formaldehyde
  - irritant contact dermatitis (itching, pain), allergic contact dermatitis, skin cancer, skin infection

Neurotoxicity

- Organophosphates, chlorinated organic compounds

Immunotoxicity

- immune deficiencies: infection, some cancer
- inappropriate immune reactivation: allergies
- unregulated immune proliferation

Reproductive and developmental toxicity

- Dibromochloropropane (DBCP)
- endocrine disruptors
- lead

Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity

- Direct acting carcinogens: arsenic, benzene
- indirect acting carcinogens or precarcinogens: PAHs, diesel particles, aromatic amines

## Classification of Toxicity

### Acute Toxicity

- sudden onset of symptoms that may last less than 24 hours (short period), sometimes can cause chronic effects
- based on median lethal dose, or LD50 value
- mainly assessed by following an oral, dermal, or inhalation exposure routes

### Chronic Toxicity

- results in the symptoms that are for a long, continuous duration, usually on a daily basis over a period of three to four months

### local toxicity

- occurs when the toxic substances causes symptoms or damages at its first contact site
- chlorine gas will react with lung tissue at site of first contact, causing damage there

### Systemic Toxicity

- toxins that get absorbed into the blood and can damage internal organs might be systemic toxins
- Phenol with prolonged exposure could damage the liver and kidneys, and increase risk of cardiovascular disease
- systemic toxicity endpoints are also referred as non-cancer toxicity

### Immediate Toxicity

- sometimes reversible, and may go away soon after the exposure is stopped. however, may be irreversible in certain cases (exposure to lead acid batteries causing permanent damage to the skin)

### Delayed Toxicity

- occurs after long-term exposure. Cancer is one example of delayed toxicity
- carcinogenic effects of chemicals occur after 20 to 30 years of the initial exposure
