# Threshold vs Non-threshold concepts

## Environmental Health Pathway: Dose

**Non-carcinogens** believed to operate through Threshold dose mechanism

**Essential Nutrients** have a J-shaped curve - small doses may be beneficial, but much much larger doses are detrimental

**Carcinogens** have no threshold - they are always detrimental at any level.

## Non-carcinogenic effect & Toxicity parameters

Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) in mg/kg weight/day
Reference Dose (RfD)

ADI or RfD = NOEL, NOAEL, LOAEL/UFs1 x UFs2 x UFs3... x MFs

UFs = Uncertainty factor, MF = Modifying factor

UFs:

1 to 10 to deal with uncertainties between species
1 to 10 to deal with variation within species
10 to deal with in only a LOEL or LOAEL is available
10 to deal with multigenerational effects
10 to deal with data quality - Modification Factor

### Benchmark dose

Alternative to NOEL and LOEL methods

- uses mathematical model
- use all bioassay data
- US EPA Benchmark Dose Software (BMDS)

## Carcinogenic Effects & Toxicity Parameters

Environment can increase cancer through carcinogenic agents in environment, which trigger genetic mutation or by increasing cytochrome P450 activities.

### Carcinogenic Categorization (by International Agency for Research on Cancer)

Group 1: sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity in humans
Group 2a: An agent is probably carcinogenic to humans
Group 2b: An agent is possibly carcinogenic to humans
Group 3: There is inadequate evidence for carcinogenicity to humans
Group 4: Probably not carcinogenic to human

### Carcinogenic Categorization (by US EPA)

A: Known human carcinogen
B: probable human carcinogen 

- B1 indicates limited human evidence
- B2 indicates sufficient evidence in animals and inadequate or no evidence in humans

C: possible human carcinogens
D: Not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity
E: No evidence of carcinogenicity in humans

## Carcinogenic Effects

### One hit Model

Assumes that a single interaction with DNA (SNP) could induce malignant change.

Simple, but not realistic model

### Two hit model

first hid produces one or more oncogene, and the 2nd hit disables the tumor suppressor gene and increases risk of cancer

Probit model

### Linearized multistage (LMS) model

During the initation process, oncogene is created and tumor suppressor gene is disabled
During the promotion stage, mutated cells begin to proliferate
During the progression stage, one or more cancerous cells begin to spread to other locations of the body

The LMS model is a statistical model that describes both linear and non-linear dose response patterns.

- assumes linearity at low doses and assumes highest estimates of exposure

Provides greater margin of protection for human health

Risk = SF * Dose
R = q_1*[risk(mg/kg/day)^-1] x exposure(mg/kg/day)
q_1* = (change in risk / change in dose)

#### Cancer slope factor

expresses the slope of the dose response function in a dose related units, such as mg/kg/ day.

Used to evaluate risks for oral or dermal exposures

#### Unit Risk Factor

expresses the slope in concentration based units.

Used to evaluate the risks for inhalation exposure.
