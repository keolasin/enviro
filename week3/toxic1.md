# Lecture 3.1.1: Intro to Toxicology, Dose alone makes the poison

## Definition of toxicology

Study of adverse effect of chemicals on living organisms

Paracelsus: "All substances are posion; there is none that is not a poison. The right dose differentiates a poison from a remedy."

**Dose**: The amount of agent that is absorbed into the organism or at the target organ. It is expressed in milligram per kg body weight.

**Exposure:** the amount of agent that comes into contact with living organisms. Sometimes even safe substances can be toxic if the dose is high enough.

## Toxicity changes with dose

Aspirin fine below 0.65g, but toxic at 9.75g, and lethal at 34g

## toxicology expansion: driving force

Exponential increase in the number of synthetically produced industrial chemicals

- American Chemical Society Registry ~ 120 million chemicals
- New chemicals/substances registered everyday (15,000)
- Regulated chemicals: >344,000

Exponential increase in the number and nature of new drugs
Enhanced public awareness of potential adverse effects of chemicals
Mandatory testing and regulation of chemicals
Litigation, principally as a consequence of occupational related illness
Environmental harms

## toxicity Testing

In vivo assays - measure the toxicity of a new chemical, typically measured in animals or cultured bacteria

In vitro assays

LD_50 - lethal dose quantity of chemicals that kills 50% of the test animals
LC_50 - lethal concentration that kills 50%

## General Principals of toxicity testing

Test before human exposure occurs
Similar routes of exposure to humans
Excess dose to which humans will be exposed
Number of animal groups used to establish dose-response relationships

## US regulatory agencies for chemicals

EPA - chemicals including industrial chemicals and pesticides
FDA - pharmaceuticals and food additives and color additives
OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) - Chemicals at workplace
Consumer Product Safety Commission - consumer products
