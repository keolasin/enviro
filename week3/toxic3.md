# Lecture 3.1.3: Animal toxicology tests and criticism

## Animal Toxicological Tests

### Acute

**Species**: Rats preferred for oral and inhalation tests; rabbits preferred for dermal tests
**Age**: Young adults
**Number**: 5 of each sex per dose level
**Dosage**: 3 dose levels; single dose or fractioned dose up to 24 hours for dermal studies; 4-hour exposure for inhalation study
**Tests**: LD50 and Driaze Test (topical toxicity)
**Observation period**: 24 hours, 7-28 days

### Prolonged or sub-chronic testing

**Species**: rats preferred for oral and inhalation tests; rabbits preferred for dermal tests; and non-rodents (dogs as a second species for oral tests)
**Age**: Young adults
**Number**: 10 of each sex for rodents; 4 of each sex for non-rodents per dose level
**Dosage**: 3 dose levels + control group (include toxic dose level and NOEL)
**Exposure period**: 90 days
**Observation period**: 90 days

### Chronic Tests

**Species**: Rats and mouse preferred
**Age**: Young adults
**Number**: 50 of each sex per dose level
**Dosage**: 3 dose levels recommended; highest should produce minimal toxicity
**Exposure period**: 18 months for mice; 24 months for rats
**Observation period**: 18-24 months for mice and 24-30 months for rats
**Measures of outcome**: Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI)

Chronic tests used to establish NOAEL or lowest observed adverse effect level, LOAEL.

### Other types of toxicology tests

#### immune toxicity test
#### skin toxicity test
#### eye toxicity test
#### Reproduction toxicity test
#### teratogenic test
#### mutagenic test

## Animal toxicological test Criticisms

- rats and mice are not humans
- dose used in animals are high and does not reflect human exposure
- metabolic variation and susceptibility of species vary greatly between and within species

Animal studies are not super useful to human toxicity for inhalation studies or pulmonary toxicity due to different physiologies

1. placement of lungs differs significantly
2. rodents are obligate nose breathers (humans use nose and mouth)
3. rodents have horizontally set lungs (upright in humans)
4. wide difference in lung capacity between rodents and humans

Another criticism is that animal studies often involve the use of high or maximum toelrated dose in a small number of animals. This is done to reduce the likelihood of observing the false negative result. However, environmental exposure is usually low for humans, and thus a maximum tolerated animal dose does not reflect human exposures.

There is great variation in toxicity of a substance based on a species. Guinea pigs are sensitive to TCDD, whereas hamsters are least sensitive to TCDD.

As well, pollutants may occur in more than one form.

Cheimcals may exhibit different level of toxicity based on interactions: 

- additive
- synergistic
- antagonistic effect

Indirect effect may be more toxic
