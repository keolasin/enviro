## Racism

"The predication of decisions and policies on considerations of race for the purpose of subordinating a racial group and maintaining control over that group."

- can be covert and/or overt
- individual racism
- institutional racism
  - when we talk about environmental justice, this is the main type of racism we're focused on

### Systemic Racism

- operates within established and respected forces in society
  - redlining - Federal gov created the policies that banks followed for lending
  - **Home-owners loans** driven by federal policies, so neighborhoods deemd "high-risk" were not given loans, and these were predominantly black
- often receives little public condemnation
- interwoven in laws, policies, and practices

"Systemic racism is based in a history of racial stereotypes, prejudices, ideologies,
images, interpretations, and narratives that support discrimination, inequities,
injustices, and racial patterns. If we neglect to recognize and address race or create
practices and policies which do not include the context of race, so if we think we can
be racially blind, we will continue to observe inequities in environmental health
conditions. And so environmental health occurs in the context of broader historic and
contemporary social and economic inequality and persistent racial and ethnic
discrimination in many sectors of our lives."

## The Environment

Environment 

- built and physical environments
  - buildings, parks, transportation infrastructure
- social environments
  - institutions, public services, community supports

A challenge to reduce Environmental health inequities has been the
inability to both recognize them as well as to solve root causes of uneven patterns of
environmental conditions between neighborhoods with different histories,
characteristics, and populations.

## History of EJ in the US

Major social movements

- civil rights movement
- environmental movement

Modern EJ movement started in 1980s

- Landmark United church of christ report, " Toxic Wastes and Race in the US" (1987) coined the term **environmental racism**
  - race found to be the most important factor for siting toxic waste sites
- multiple protests to stop the siting of landfills (e.g. PCBs), re-zone power plants, and stop the spraying of pesticides in communities of color.

### Initial focus

Initially focused on the location of hazardous facilities

- expanded to include enforcement issues
- multiple and cumulative effects
  - toxic hot spots
- other vulnerable groups
- non-hazardous themes (e.g., parks)

### Example: The case of lead poisoning

- most exposures are poorly understood
- minority children have been found to disproportionately suffer from lead poisoning
- poor nutrition contributes to childhood lead poisoning
  - nutritional deficienies increase kids susceptibility to lead toxicity
  - minority kids more likely to be at greater risk of marginal nutritional status than white kids
- minority and low-income children found to have higher exposures to lead
  - lead from lead-based paints (in older houses)
  - lead contaminated neighborhoods due to lead-based gas
- removal of lead in paint in 70s and in gasoline 1990

### EJ and proximity to hazards

EJ literature highlights that proximity to environmental health hazards results in greater exposures:

- contaminated air
- noise pollution
- use and storage of hazardous materials
- emissions of hazardous and toxic substances
- contaminated soil and water
- diminished traffic safety
- illegal dumping
- poor enforcement of environmental regulations
- inadequate response to environmental complaints
- inferior housing
- fewer amenities (parks, etc)

### Commonly reported EJ health outcomes

- adverse pregnancy outcomes
- childhood cancers
- asthma hospitalizations and chronic respiratory symptoms
- stroke mortality
- PCB toxicity
- end-stage renal disease
- diabetes

## GIS - geographic info systems

Spatial analyses to assess disproportionate:

- exposures
- risks
- health outcomes

Common geospatial methods:

- spatial coincidence analysis
- distance-based analysis
- pollution plume modeling

### Spatial Coincidence Analysis

Proximity to environmental hazards

- ZIP codes, census tracts, block groups, containing a hazard
- identify enviro hazards on a map
- classify spatial units based on exposure (yes/no)
- compare socio-demographic characteristics of exposed and unexposed groups

### Distance-based Analysis

Circular buffer analyses often use buffers of uniform radius around hazard sources

- studies often use multiple circular rings at increasing distances from hazard sources
- Strengths: Now, the advantages are that it does not assume that the adverse effects are restricted solely to the boundaries of spatial units hosting the hazard, like the previous example. It's easily to do using GIS software, and it makes statistical comparisons fairly easy
- Limitations are that the buffer radius is selected arbitrarily, and it assumes adverse effects of a hazard are limited only inside the buffer area. It also assumes that the adverse effects are equal and uniform in all directions, so isotropic from the hazard

### Pollution Plume Modeling

integrates air dispersion modeling with GIS to accurately estimate areas and populations exposed to air releases of pollution

## Challenges in Conducting EJ Studies

- Use of one address to assign exposure
  - residential proximity used to assign exposure status
- potential residual confounding
  - race/ethnicity
  - SES
  - parental occupation

### Disentangling confounders

Which came first, the hazard, or the people?

- a 30-year study in LA basin showed that polluting facilities were much more often sited in minority communities
- even if people move to a contaminated neighborhood, the questions that remain are:
  - "Who benefits from current siting and pollution control practices, and who pays the consequences?"
  - "How are these impacts affected by ongoing policies and enforcement practices?"

## Health Impact Assessment (HIAs)

A tool that is used to understand the health consequences of a policy or project

Steps:

1. ID policy or project where HIA would be applicable
2. analyze and ID potential health impacts
3. conduct assessment (qualitative/quantitative)
4. develop recommendations
5. Report results to decision makers
6. evaluate and monitor effects as a result of HIA

## CBPR (Community based participatory research)

Roots from Berkeley(!)

An academic-community collaboration
CBPR has the potential to:

- enhance community empowerment
- increase co-learning between community members and scientists
- improve community organizing efforts
- link research to policy action

### Some of the problems addressed by CBPR

By including the community from the beginning, can insure the community is truly involved

## Social Inequality is bad for the environment

Inequality is associated with a higher level of environmental contamination

- asymmetries in political power
- intensity of a society's consumption
- decrease social cohesion and lack of cooperation to protect common resources
  - access to safe water, improved sanitation, air pollution

## EJ and climate change

- vast differences in climate change impacts for:
  - poor vs. wealthy communities
  - high-income countries vs low- and middle- income countries

## Current EJ issues in the US

- US has withdrawn from the Paris climate accord
- research has been dropped for contradicting political preferences
- many industry consultants appointed to federal environmental health agencies
- emission standards have been weakened
- major expansions of land and water available for oil and gas
- subsidized coal industry

## Summary

We need to understand systemic racism and how it affects environmental health inequities

There are disproportionate impacts on communities

Social Determinants of Health are included in EJ (access to food, water, safe places to play/exercise)

Collaboration is key to future research
